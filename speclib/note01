description: This item is a note, or memorandum - that is, something you
don't want to forget, but for which it is not appropriate to schedule a
meeting/appointment or assign a task with a deadline.  The
expiration_date is optional, but if you fill it in, it represents the
date/time at which this note either becomes useless to you or that
represents an approximate final date on which you think you should be reminded
of the data (which typically will be all or part of the description) attached
to this note.  For example, if you put your departed mother's diary in a
special place, but don't want to think about the diary for a few years, you
could create a note for it, with an expiration date, say, 10 years from now
and with reminders for 5, 7, and 9 years from now.  This will allow you to
forget about the diary for years, but be reminded of it in 5 years and in
2-year increments after that; and you'll get a final reminder in 10 years -
for the expiration_date.  If the expiration_date is blank or not present, it
will essentially be regarded as an expiration date infinitely in the future
(or, put another way, the date of the end of the universe).  This will
allow you to see the note in reports and not ever allow it to expire, as well
as, if you've specified reminder-dates, to be reminded of it on those dates.
For the sake of being complete, here's an actual description of this
fictional example:

When Mom died in 2013 she left a diary behind - actually, she left behind 7
notebooks that cover the last 20 years or so of her life.  The diaries are
now in the safe in the main bedroom in our old house in Houston, Texas.
This note is to remind myself that this diary exists and to go get it and
read it and/or put it in a safer place, such as a safety deposit box, at
some appropriate time in the future.
